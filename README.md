### **1. PROJECT BACKGROUND**

In the fifth semester, students across 12 departments gets to enroll in a course, out of 13 options. The students are mandated to fill in a form. The form requires students to fill in their informations such as gross points from the first two semesters, choice fillings from first to sixth along with their unique id and parent department information. The students will be elected based on the priority of choices and gross percentage scores.

***
### **2. ABOUT THE DATA**

The data was collected by the Department of Statistics. The mode of collection of data was facilitated by using [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/ "See OnlineðŸ’¡") which the students had to fill in. Data from the year 2019 & 2020 were used conveniently for comparison purposes. The data collected was then made to undergo a few transformations and some basic cleaning in [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel "See OnlineðŸ’¡").

*fig 3.0. showing the Total Count of Top 3 Choices received to each Open Course Subjects.*
- On both years, It is evident that the open course subject of **Sociology** had the most demand followed by **Economics**.
- While **Hindi** had received the least of interest from the students.

### **Top Choice Allotted Proportion (2019-2020)**

![Chart](Charts/Bar-plots/FA-FC-ALlot-Prop.png)
*fig 4.0. shows the proportion of students being allotted to the first choice*
- We can observe that on both years, nearly 80% of students were usually admitted to the first choice that they preferred.

### **Heatmap - Allotment Proportion of Parent Departments (2019-2020)**

![Heatmap](Charts/Heatmaps/Parent-Allot-Heatmap.png)
*fig 5.0. Heatmap showing the proportion of students from parent department to the allotted open course subjects*
- The above [heatmap](https://www.hotjar.com/heatmaps/ "See OnlineðŸ’¡") depicts a general trend where students in the art departments are allotted to another art departments and vice-versa for science departments.
- There were less consolidation of students in 2020 as compared to that in the year 2019, As a result we are able to observe that students have been distributed ti different courses.

### **Heatmap - Change in Allotment Proportion of Parent Departments (2019-2020)**

![Heatmap](Charts/Heatmaps/Parent-Allot-Change.png)
*fig 5.1. Heatmap showing the proportion of students from parent department to the allotted open course subjects*
- There was a significant increase in the students being admitted from **B.Sc. Mathematics** to **Commerce**, **B.Sc. Physics** to **Sociology** and to **Mathematics**.
- There was a significant decrease in the students being admitted from **B.Sc. Physics** to **Commerce**, **B.Sc. Botany** to **B.Sc. Chemistry. [See Fig 5.1 for more]

*fig 5.2. [Network Diagram](https://acqnotes.com/acqnote/tasks/network-diagram "See OnlineðŸ’¡") showing the top course allotted by each parent department*
- In the year 2019, **Statistics**, **Mathematics**, **Commerce** and **Chemistry** had students allotted from more than one departments.
- In the year 2020, due to less consolidation only two courses had students being allotted from parent departments. As a result **Commerce** and **Mathematics** are the subjects with more than one departments.

***

### **Heatmap - Allotment Proportion in Open Course Subjects (2019-2020)**
![Heatmap](Charts/Heatmaps/Target-Allot-Heatmaps.png)
- The general trend observed is similar to that from *[fig 5.0](#heatmap---Allotment-proportion-of-parent-departments-2019-2020)* where students in arts subjects are mostly from art departments and vice-versa for science open course subjects.
- **Economics** and **English** subjects had a healthy mix of students from multiple departments in both years.
- **B.Sc Zoology** students have a significant proportion in Chemistry open courses in both years. Likewise, **B.Com Model I** students also has a great presence in **Statistics**.
- **B.A. History** students have a notable presence in **Hindi** open courses in 2019 but not in 2020.

- Arts subjects contributed more to certain departments while the science students were spread equally across departments.
- In 2019, **B.A. History**, **B.A. Sociology**, **B.Com. Model I**, **B.Sc. Botany** contributed to multiple departments.
- In 2020, similarly **B.A. History** ,**B.A. Sociology**, **B.Com. Model I** and **B.A. Economics** contributed more to various departments.

*fig. 5.5. shows the first choice proportion of students*
- Yearly Consistency: The pattern of preference remains relatively consistent between 2019 and 2020.
- On both years B.Sc. Zoology** students preferred **Chemistry**, similarly similar interest were also observed from **B.Sc. Chemistry** to **Mathematics** and from **B.Com Model I** to **Statistics**

### **Heatmap - Change in First Choice (2019-2020)**
![Heatmp](Charts/Heatmaps/FC-Change-Prop_Heatmap.png)
*fig. 5.6 shows the change in first choice proportions of students*
- An increase in the interest of (+32%) from **B.Sc. Mathematics** to **Commerce** was observed. A similar interest was also observed from **B.Sc. History** to **Physical Education**.
- A significant decrease of (-55%) was observed from **B.Sc. Botany** to **Chemistry**.

### **Top Choices (2019-2020)**
![Network diagram](Charts/Network-plots/TOP-FC-NTQ.png)
*fig. 5.7. showing the network diagram representing the top elective course prefered by departmeants*
- In 2019, **Mathematics** and **Physical Education** was the top choices of students in nearly 3 parent departments.
- In 2020 however **Commerce** was the only subject to have had the top choices of students. **Mathematics** and **History** were other course receiving high demands of choices.
- On both years **Physics**, **Hindi**, **English** and **Hindi** were courses with little to no choice applications.
